# Fourth Meeting
March 27th, 2017 @ 5:00pm, B-Atrium

As of this point our work velocity was low from our previous iteration on March 13th.
No new features implemented at this time, fixing game mechanics and export bugs.

This meeting is to finalize what licenses we will be using, the features left to implement, and additional feedback.

# Client's Feedback
Wanted so that player's can drop previous atom picked. Levels to be finished, emphasized that survey should have meaningful questions. Mentioned the previous project had poor survey feedback.

# Features to implement
* Randomize rooms
* On level retry, give hints to player
* Player can drop atoms
* Survey needs to be more sufficient (minimum 10 questions that are meaningful)
* Need to finish all rooms before getting feedback (hints for each molecule) from Dr. Gluick
