# Fourth Meeting
March 27th, 2017 @ 5:00pm, B-Atrium

As of this point our work velocity was low from our previous iteration on March 13th.
No new features implemented at this time, fixing game mechanics and export bugs.

This meeting is to finalize what licenses we will be using, the features left to implement, and additional feedback.
