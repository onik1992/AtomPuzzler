# Fourth Meeting
March 13th, 2017 @ 5:00pm, B-Atrium

Meet with Dr. Guick with minor improvements to our 2nd iteration.

# Client's Feedback
Our client is very impressed with how our project is progressing. Dr. Guick stated that he will show our current iteration to some colleagues on March 17 to gain more feedback about the game.

### Client's new requirements
* Room randomization upon entering level.
* Depending on the number of player's attempts, they should be given a hint on retry level.
